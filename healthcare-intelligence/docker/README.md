# Docker Implementation - Learning Journey

## Learning Approach
This Docker implementation demonstrates systematic approach to containerization for deployment awareness. As someone new to Docker, I focused on:

### 1. Foundation Concepts
- Container vs. VM understanding
- Image layering and optimization
- Service orchestration with docker-compose
- Health monitoring and validation

### 2. Professional Practices
- Multi-stage builds for optimization
- Health checks for service reliability
- Proper networking and volume management
- Production-aware configuration

### 3. Business Context
- Deployment readiness demonstration
- Enterprise thinking about scalability
- Professional documentation and troubleshooting
- Integration with existing healthcare analytics

## Technical Decisions

### Why Docker Compose vs. Kubernetes?
- **Learning Focus**: Master fundamentals before complexity
- **Demonstration Purpose**: Show deployment awareness appropriate for entry-level
- **Professional Growth**: Foundation for future Kubernetes learning

### Why These Services?
- **MLflow**: Industry-standard experiment tracking
- **Streamlit**: Business stakeholder accessibility
- **API**: Real-time integration capability

## Next Steps for Production
- Security hardening and HIPAA compliance
- Load balancing and horizontal scaling
- Advanced monitoring and logging
- CI/CD pipeline integration

## Service Architecture

### MLflow Service
- **Purpose**: Centralized experiment tracking and model registry
- **Port**: 5001
- **Health Check**: API endpoint validation
- **Dependencies**: None (base service)
- **Data Persistence**: ./mlruns volume mount

### Healthcare Dashboard Service
- **Purpose**: Streamlit web application for business stakeholders
- **Port**: 8501
- **Health Check**: HTTP endpoint validation
- **Dependencies**: MLflow service (waits for healthy status)
- **Data Access**: Full application volume mount

### Network Configuration
- **Network**: healthcare_network (bridge mode)
- **Service Discovery**: Services communicate via service names
- **Isolation**: All services in dedicated network

## Usage Commands

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View service status
docker-compose ps

# View service logs
docker-compose logs healthcare_dashboard
docker-compose logs mlflow

# Stop services
docker-compose down
