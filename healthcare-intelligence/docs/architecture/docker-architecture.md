# Docker Architecture - Healthcare Intelligence Platform

## System Overview
Professional containerization architecture demonstrating deployment readiness and production awareness for healthcare analytics platform.

## Container Architecture

### Multi-Stage Build Strategy
- **Dependencies Stage**: Isolated dependency installation with build tools
- **Application Stage**: Minimal runtime environment with security hardening
- **Optimization**: Reduced image size and improved security posture

### Service Orchestration
- **MLflow Service**: Centralized experiment tracking (Port 5001)
- **Healthcare Dashboard**: Streamlit application (Port 8501)
- **Network**: Isolated bridge network for service communication

### Security Implementation
- Non-root user execution
- Minimal runtime dependencies
- Health check monitoring
- Environment variable management

## Production Considerations

### Scalability Design
- Resource limits configured for production deployment
- Multi-replica support with shared data persistence
- Network isolation for security

### Monitoring Integration
- Health checks for service reliability
- Logging configuration for observability
- Performance metrics collection

### Deployment Pipeline
- Development: docker-compose for local testing
- Production: Kubernetes migration path documented
- CI/CD: Container registry integration ready
